abstract: 'Considering the the Brazilian Law nº 9.433/1997 (BRASIL, 1997) recommendation that the water quality and quantity should not be dissociated, this research presents the Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) calculation as an important tool to better assess and equilibrate both aspects in the context of the Brazillian Water Quality Classification Framework. The objective of this research is to determine the loading rate that would be consistent with meeting the Water Quality Criteria (WQC) to the case study reservoirs in Paranapanema watershed, which is known as the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) calculation, in order to answer the question: “How much pollution is the reservoir capable of receive without compromising the reservoir planning and management?”. In order to find out the acceptable load limits, the corresponding load compatible with the water quality standards from CONAMA 357/2005 resolution was calculated. The results showed the estimated phosphorus concentrations in the case study of the Paranapanema watershed were superior to the TMDL limits in the most of the future loading scenarios.'
